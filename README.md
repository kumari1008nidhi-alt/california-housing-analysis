 "Multiple Linear Regression analysis of California housing prices with comprehensive EDA"
This project analyzes California housing data to predict median house prices using multiple linear regression. The dataset contains 20,640 entries with features including location, demographics, and income. Exploratory analysis revealed that total rooms has the largest variance (47 million), indicating extreme variation in housing density across regions.
The regression model achieves an R² score of 0.65, explaining 65% of price variance. Key findings show coastal properties command a 20-30% premium, and each $10,000 income increase raises prices by approximately $8,300. The model provides valuable insights for real estate valuation and market analysis.
